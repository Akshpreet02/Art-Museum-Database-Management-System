The system, built in Python, integrates an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram transformed into a relational data model. It features a multi-faceted user interface, differentiating roles from administrators to end-users, enabling SQL command executions, intuitive data entry, and user-friendly database browsing. Embedded user management ensures role-specific access and secure login functionalities, enhancing both the utility and security of the platform.
